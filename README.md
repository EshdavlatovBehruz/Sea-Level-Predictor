# Sea-Level-Predictor
Sea Level Predictor 

This project analyzes global average sea level change data from 1880 to present 
and predicts sea level rise through the year 2050 using Python and data science tools.
It is based on the dataset provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Visualize historic sea level data.
Predict future sea level rise using linear regression (to 2050).

Compare:
1.The overall trend since 1880.
2.The recent trend since the year 2000.


- Creates a scatter plot of the sea level data.
- Draws two lines of best fit:
    - One for all data (1880â€“2050).
    - One for data from the year 2000 to 2050.
- Saves the graph as `sea_level_plot.png`.

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scipy

## Output:
The plot shows how sea level has changed and gives predictions for the future.
